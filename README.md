# BRL-Evaluation

## ABSTRACT

Dr. Rudin and her team introduced a generative model called Bayesian Rule Lists that yields a posterior distribution over possible decision lists in 2015. They derived a stoke model using the MarketScan Medicaid Multi-State Database (MDCD) containing administrative claims data for 11.1 million Medicaid enrollees from multiple states (Benjamin, 2015). In this project, we implement Dr.Rudinâ€™s algorithm and derive a survivor model using the popular titanic dataset provided by Kaggle (Titanic, 2022). Our goal is two-fold: to validate and evaluate the algorithm in terms of performance and computational efficiency, and to compare the results with other models such as random forests in terms of interpretability and prediction accuracy.
